#Longform template
### A cookbook to make longform journalism look as good as possible online. Made for those learning responsive webdesign and developers looking for a streamlined toolkit.

This template is for people of all skill levels not looking to start from scratch on their new website. Tweaks and changes are encouraged as it is only the boilerplate for you to build on. 

This is the second version of the template, so bugs might pop up. The only way to fix them is to know about them, so please contact me or use this [goolge form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZyCtO9zSwpZdcAiu2).

 You can view some examples of stories developed with earlier versions of the template here.
